Some highlights of my configs (that I can recall):

- (By default)Everytime i3 is restarted, my script selects and sets a random wallpaper from the specified directory. On top that it also sets colorscheme using [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). So if you get bored, just refresh i3 :wink: .
- My fish shell now has a vi mode :smiley: .
- Key bindings for spotify using [spotify client](https://github.com/pwittchen/spotify-cli-linux) :musical_note: .
- Zathura in night mode uses pywal.
- Rofi also uses pywal. So you better be ready with some nice wallpapers.
- My i3 has mouse mode. The mouse pointer can be controlled by keyboard. I never use it but I found code snippet internet and thought of hoarding it.

I got Zathura-pywal from [here](https://github.com/GideonWolfe/Zathura-Pywal) .My suckless terminal, ranger, dunst and zathura configs are based on [Luke Smith's](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) config files. I have modified them a bit to my own taste.
